# Islandora-Cookbook

## Introduction

In the spirit of [Islandora Awesome](https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora_awesome), Islandora Cookbook is a curated list of great modules and other tools for Islandora 8. Because Islandora 8 is more tightly integrated with Drupal, most of these 'recipes' require only Drupal modules as ingredients.

We offer this list for discovery, but do not officially provide support for any of these modules.
